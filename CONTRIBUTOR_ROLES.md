Invited Experts have a track record of contributions, participation, and reviews, or have proven knowledge in a certain area of expertise.

- The nominee will add a comment to the pull request agreeing to all responsibilities of becoming an Invited Expert.
- To be accepted, the pull request needs three approvals. This can be any combination of Invited Experts, or Maintainers.
- Once the pull request is approved, the new Invited Expert is added to the [invited-experts team](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/invited-experts) and the appropriate topic team.

## Maintainer

#### Process for nominating a Maintainer

- The nominee will add a comment to the pull request agreeing to all responsibilities of becoming a Maintainer.
- At least three current Maintainers must approve the pull request.
- Once the pull request is approved, the new Maintainer is added to the [maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/maintainers) and any other relevant topic or project teams.

### Maintainer responsibilities

In addition to the responsibilities of all other roles, a Maintainer has these additional responsibilities:

- Determining priorities for the project.
- Participating in community meetings.
- Mentoring new and existing contributors across all other roles.
- If appropriate, based on the skill set of the maintainer:
  - Propose, approve, or implement code and infrastructure improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement content improvements.
  - Propose, approve, or implement process improvements.

## Community Manager

The Community Manager role is distinct in many respects. Still, as the projects are technical, the role shares many of the same requirements and responsibilities as the Maintainer role.

In addition to the responsibilities of a Maintainer, the Community Manager has these additional responsibilities.

- Along with Maintainers, address reports where the code of conduct has been violated and decide on the appropriate action.
- Organize and run community events.
- Determine media strategies to promote the project and onboard new contributors and users.
- Define and implement the onboarding experience.
- Organize community-related project meetings.
- Meet with and ensure a healthy relationship with contributors and partners.
- Assist with issue triage as well as pull request review where appropriate.
- Responsible for monitoring all communication channels, including discussions on GitHub.
- Highlight contributors that have done exceptional work and/or have shown dedication to the project and organization.
- Ensure the health and well-being of the project and all participants.
- Identify and assist with the implementation of automation to improve project sustainability.

## Inactivity

Participants must be active to set an example and show commitment to the project.
Conversely, inactivity harms the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project.

Inactivity is measured by:

- Periods of no contributions for longer than two months.
- Periods of no communication for longer than a month.

Consequences of being inactive include:

- Involuntary removal or demotion
- Being asked to move to Emeritus status

### Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met.
This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of the role, or a violation of the Code of Conduct.
This process is essential because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opening up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

During a maintainers meeting, a participant can ask to demote or remove a contributor.
In addition, the participant is responsible for adding supporting information to the meeting agenda.
Finally, the matter will be discussed and brought to a vote by all maintainers and community managers.

Please communicate with the community team to avoid the above process should your time commitments change.
In these cases, you can instead proactively choose to step down for a while or move to Emeritus status (see below).

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process

If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to Emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the community team about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
