# Steering Committee Governance

The MDN Web Docs Steering Committee is the governing body of the MDN Web Docs project,
providing decision-making and oversight pertaining to the project bylaws,
sub-organizations, and financial planning. The Steering Committee also defines
the project values and structure.

This governance document is an open, living document, and will continue to
evolve as the community and project change.

## Values

The MDN Web Docs project and its leadership embrace the following values:

- Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.

- Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

- Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

- Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

- Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.

## Charter

The following responsibilities and powers belong to the Steering Committee.

Technical governance is expected to be performed by the Maintainers of the
various project areas and subprojects, as defined in the appropriate OWNERS files.

- Delegate ownership of, responsibility for and authority over areas of the
  project to specific entities.
- Define, evolve, and defend the vision, mission and the values of the project.
- Charter and refine policy for defining new community groups, and establish
  transparency and accountability policies for such groups
- Define and evolve project and group governance structures and policies.
- Act as a final escalation point for disputes in any project repository or
  group.
- Request funds and other support from the Mozilla Corporation.
- Coordinate with Mozilla regarding usage of the MDN Web Docs brand and deciding
  project scope, core requirements, and conformance, as well as how that brand
  can be used in relation to other efforts or vendors.
- Decide, for the purpose of elections, who is a member of standing, and what
  privileges that entails.
- Control and delegate access to and establish processes regarding all project
  repositories, resources, and assets.

## Committee Meetings

The Steering Committee meets once a quarter, or as-needed.
Meetings are held online, and are public by default.

Given the private nature of some of these discussions (e.g. privacy, private
emails to the committee, code of conduct violations, escalations, disputes
between members, security reports, etc.) some meetings are held in private.

Meeting notes are available to all members and public meetings will be recorded and the recordings made available publicly.

Questions and proposals for changes to governance or community procedures are posted as
[discussions in the community repo](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions), and
the Steering Committee invites your feedback there. See, [getting in touch](#getting-in-touch) for other options.

## Committee members

| &nbsp; | Member | Organization |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |

## Decision process

The Steering Committee desires to always reach consensus.

Decisions requiring a vote include: issuing written policy, amending existing written policy, official responses to publicly raised issues, or any other decisions that at least two of the members present decide require a vote.

Decisions are made in meetings when a quorum of more than half of the members are present (and all members have been informed of the meeting), and may pass with more than half the members of the committee supporting it.

## Getting in touch

There are two ways to raise issues to the steering committee for decision:

1. Emailing the Steering Committee at mdn-web-docs-community (at) mozilla (.com). This is a private discussion list to which all members of the committee have access.
2. Open an issue on [the MDN Web Docs meta repository](https://github.com/mdn/mdn/) and indicate that you would like attention from the steering committee.

## Changes to the charter

Changes to this charter may be proposed via a PR on the charter itself.
Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee as per the
[decision process](#decision-process) outlined above.

Proposals and amendments to the charter are available for at least a period of
one week for comments and questions before a vote will occur.

## Authority, Facilitation, and Decision Making

Ideally most decisions will be made at the lowest possible level within the project: within individual working groups. When this is not possible, the steering committee can help facilitate a conversation to work through the contended issue. When facilitation by the steering committee does not resolve the contention, the steering committee may have to make a decision.

Note that if the committee is called to resolve contended decisions regularly, it is a
symptom of a larger problem in the community that will need to be addressed.
